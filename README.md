# COOKIE

Cookie is a program made by me so you can check your PC'S components (maybe your phone)

# TRUST THIS PROGRAM
You can safely check your PC'S components without any hussle! Just lines of code that check what parts your PC has! even though there is a Windows program for this, this program is simple and can tell you what components are bad or good!

# UPDATE: WORK IN PROGRESS
No update yet.

# Checks for components
This program checks for components that are listed in "SystemInformation" (the windows program i mentioned) and any other findable components.

# What code does this use?
This program will use C++.
